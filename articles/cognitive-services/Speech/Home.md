# Bing Speech API Overview
Welcome to Speech Service – Microsoft’s speech recognition and text to speech cloud offering which helps users to voice-enable their applications and bring in a delightful conversational experience. 

Microsoft Speech Service has two APIs :
* Speech To Text  :   
	Using REST API : For apps converting short spoken commands (upto 15 seconds) to text without real-time streaming or user feedback.  
	Using WebSocket API : For apps converting long audio (upto 10 minutes) to text with intermediate results.
* Text To Speech API : For apps converting text into audio that can be played back to the user. 

## Speech to text (Speech Recognition)
Microsoft's Speech Service *transcribes* audio streams into text suitable for display to a user. Transcription includes adding appropriate capitalization and punctuation, masking profanity, and normalizing text. For example, if a user says `remind me to buy six pencils`, Microsoft's Speech Services will return the transcribed text `Remind me to buy 6 pencils.`
There are two options for adding speech recognition capabilities to your app:
* The REST API uses chunked-transfer encoding to convert short spoken commands without real-time streaming or user feedback.
* The WebSocket API uses full-duplex communication to convert longer audio input and supports intermediate results.
Use this comparison chart to help you choose the API that fits your needs.

### Quick feature comparison
Here is a quick comparison of features between the REST and Websocket APIs for speech recognition.

| Feature | WebSocket API | REST API |

| Subscription Key Authorization | Yes | No |
| Reco Results | Lexical, Itn, Masked | Lexical, Itn, Masked |
| N-Best | Up to 5 | Up to 5 |
| Confidence | Yes| Yes |

## Text to speech (Speech Synthesis)
The speech synthesis REST API provides real-time text to speech conversion in a variety of different voices and languages. The maximum amount of audio returned for any single request must not exceed 15 seconds.
